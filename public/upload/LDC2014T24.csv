ID-0205,PID-0103,ADSVYOL1W08WO,"I have never purchased a George Foreman grill; the infomercials alone were enough to scare me off. When I moved into my apartment a few months back, I realized that my roommate, the consummate college student, had a George Foreman Next Generation grill that he never used, and I figured it was worth a shot. Maybe the former boxing champ slapped his name on something pretty stupendous, if it's been around this long, right? The result was less than stellar.<br/><br/>I bought a couple steaks as the first and final test of the product; it's hard to screw up a good steak, after all, so regardless of how hit-or-miss the product was, I'd still eat well. The George Foreman grill took a good 15 minutes to warm up, and went from ""stone cold"" to ""nearly on fire"" almost instantaneously after that. The steaks didn't cook evenly, the non-stick surface didn't, and cleaning the thing is a nightmare unto itself. I can see how a college kid would love this thing, and for that it's fantastic. As an actual kitchen appliance, it's a waste of forty dollars.

The microwaves were dirty inside when I made a quick snack at night. Also the owner was quite questionable, as we're the other residents. Very run down motel.. My husband and I also woke up in the middle of the night itching, we pulled up the sheets and found bed bugs. We' then packed our stuff and left. I would NEVER EVER recommend anybody stay at this motel. When we approached the owners about the bugs, all they said was "" we know, we are trying to get rid of them"". They shoud be reported to the health inspector.",Hotels,neg,T,self,682,3.7,0.65,1.0,1385,"[1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]","[F, F, F, F, F, F, F, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",Y,Y,http://www.yellowpages.com/broken-bow-ne/mip/wagon-wheel-motel-camp-grnds-1171507/reviews?lid=1171507,-,-,-
